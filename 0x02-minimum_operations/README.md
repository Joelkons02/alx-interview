## Task

### 0. Minimum Operations

In a text file, there is a single character 'H'. Your text editor can execute only two operations in this file: Copy All and Paste. Given a number 'n', write a method that calculates the fewest number of operations needed to result in exactly 'n H' characters in the file.

**Prototype:**
```python
def minOperations(n)
