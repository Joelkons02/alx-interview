## Overview

Welcome to the Pascal's Triangle project! In this project, you will be implementing a Python function to generate Pascal's Triangle up to a specified number of rows (n). Pascal's Triangle is a mathematical construct that has a wide range of applications in combinatorics and probability theory.

## Concepts

This project is designed to reinforce your understanding of technical interview concepts.

## Tasks

### 0. Pascal's Triangle

**Task:** Create a Python function `pascal_triangle(n)` that returns a list of lists of integers representing Pascal's Triangle up to the nth row.

- Returns an empty list if n <= 0.
- You can assume n will always be an integer.

Example:

```python
pascal_triangle(5)
